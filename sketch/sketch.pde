/*
  Design Requirements
    Using Processing, open the sketch folder in this repo. 
        Do all your work in this sketch and do not rename the folder or its containing .pde file.
    
    Create a canvas that is 640 Ã— 400.
    
    Design a creature that resembles a sentient being.
    
    Use one neutral (black, white, gr{e|a}y, brown, beige, bronze, cream) 
        and one non-neutral color in the design of your creature.
    
    Pressing any of the arrow keys moves your creature by a factor of 1. 
        You decide the definition of the factor. (factor=4 pixels; factor=8 pixels; etc.)
    
    Pressing non-arrow keys should be ignored.
    
    Make your creature point in only one direction, regardless of which of the four arrow keys is pressed.
    
    Holding any of the arrow keys should not do anything more than move your creature by a factor of 1.
